These results suggest that if a participant has less dispersed absolute saccade angles, shorter
fixations and saccades, coupled with smaller convex hull and
fewer clicks, it is likely that the person will be successful at
evaluating the correctness of the given mapping set

if the participant spends less time searching for points of
interests with an overall shorter scanpath, she/he is less likely
to be successful at evaluating the precision of the given
mappings


Decision Tree model had highest accuracy

 if
the participant has less dispersed search angles as well as
fixation and saccadic durations, combined with a smaller search
area, quicker saccadic searches, and fewer clicks, she/he is more
likely to be successful at evaluating the completeness of the
given mapping set. If the participant has fewer changes in pupil
dilation, she/he is less likely to be successful at recalling
